# Pregnancy Risk Prediction System

This project aims to predict and monitor heart disease in real-time using Machine Learning (ML) and IoT technologies. The system uses sensor data to make predictions and provides alerts for high-risk patients. By analyzing user-inputted physiological data and the system provides personalized risk predictions and health insights to support early intervention and safer pregnancies.

# Project Overview

This project combines Machine Learning and mobile health technology to create a real-time maternal health risk prediction and monitoring system. The ML model analyzes user-inputted physiological data such as blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose to predict pregnancy risk levels. The mobile application serves as the interface for data input, personalized feedback, and health guidance, empowering pregnant women to manage their health proactively and complement traditional antenatal care.
